# Environment configuration

I've likely spent several years attempting to get my environment absolutely correct. From the first
days that I was typing away on UNIX I always wanted to customize. Now in my ripe old age I really just
want everything to be the same! If I am having [at work][1] or just at home it all *needs* to be the same.

I suggest going through this project and seeing exactly how I manage everything. Its actually relatively
easy once you get the hang of it.
